# uipy3

the script runs .defailt.uipy3 in the current directory and then leaves an ipython running.

If you wish, you can use it with a custom file such as .namefile.uipy3 and save it in the current directory and then use it with:
upy3 .namefile.uipy3

or

you can use it with -s to list and select a file from the directory ~ / uipy3
